## [2.0.0-alpha.1] - 2025-07-29

### Added
- **LAN Access Configuration**: Configured both frontend and backend servers for network accessibility
  - **Why**: Enable testing and access from multiple devices on the local network
  - **How**: Modified server bindings to use 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost, added environment configuration
  - **Where**: Backend server.js now binds to 0.0.0.0:5000, React dev server configured with HOST=0.0.0.0
  - **Result**: Application accessible from any device on LAN at http://192.168.0.168:3000

- **Database Interface Migration**: Completed SQLite to PostgreSQL syntax conversion for authentication and cards
  - **Why**: Resolve runtime errors caused by incompatible database method calls between SQLite and PostgreSQL
  - **How**: Converted db.all(), db.get(), db.run() calls to PostgreSQL query() with proper async/await and $1 parameters
  - **Where**: Fixed auth.js login/registration endpoints and cards.js CRUD operations
  - **Result**: Authentication and card management now fully operational with PostgreSQL backend

- **Frontend API Configuration**: Implemented dynamic API base URL configuration for LAN access
  - **Why**: React proxy only works for localhost, needed direct backend communication for LAN access
  - **How**: Created apiConfig.js with environment-based API URL construction using REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL
  - **Where**: Added client/.env with backend URL, updated Login.js to use dynamic API endpoints
  - **Result**: Frontend can communicate with backend server across network

### Fixed
- **Runtime Errors**: Resolved React component errors blocking application startup
  - **Why**: Application was crashing with null reference and lexical declaration errors
  - **How**: Added null checks in ErrorBoundary component and fixed useEffect hook ordering
  - **Where**: Fixed ErrorBoundary.js componentStack access and App.js useEffect dependency issues
  - **Result**: Application starts cleanly without runtime errors

- **Authentication Schema Mismatch**: Corrected password field reference in authentication
  - **Why**: Database schema uses password_hash field but auth code was looking for password field
  - **How**: Updated auth.js to reference user.password_hash instead of user.password in bcrypt comparison
  - **Where**: Modified login and registration endpoints in src/routes/auth.js
  - **Result**: User authentication now works correctly with proper password validation

- **Admin Role Detection**: Fixed admin privilege assignment for user accounts
  - **Why**: JWT tokens used is_admin field but database stores role enum ('admin'/'user')
  - **How**: Updated login endpoint to check user.role === 'admin' and convert to boolean isAdmin
  - **Where**: Modified JWT token creation in auth.js login function
  - **Result**: Admin users now receive proper admin privileges in JWT tokens

- **Database Schema Alignment**: Updated cards API to match actual PostgreSQL schema
  - **Why**: Frontend was sending requests with fields that don't exist in database (owner, deck)
  - **How**: Modified cards routes to use user_id instead of owner, removed deck references, added JOIN for username
  - **Where**: Updated cards.js GET/POST/DELETE endpoints and App.js card creation
  - **Result**: Card operations now work correctly with proper database schema

### Changed
- **Production Console Output Cleanup**: Completed comprehensive cleanup of debug output for production readiness
  - **Why**: Remove debug console.log statements from production code for cleaner logs and better performance
  - **How**: Replaced 33 console.log statements with proper Winston logging or removed entirely
  - **Where**: Frontend React components and backend database modules cleaned up
  - **Result**: Production-ready application with clean logging and no debug output clutter

- **Modular Architecture**: Completely restructured codebase from monolithic to modular design
  - **Why**: Improve code maintainability, readability, and testing by separating concerns
  - **How**: Split 1669-line `server-auth.js` into logical modules with clear responsibilities
  - **Where**: New `/src` directory structure with organized subdirectories
  - **How**: Created database adapter pattern allowing seamless switching between SQLite/PostgreSQL
  - **Where**: `/src/utils/database-postgres.js`, `/src/utils/database-adapter.js`, `/scripts/setup-postgresql.sh`
  - **Features**: UUID primary keys, JSONB columns, full-text search, connection pooling, advanced indexing

- **Enhanced Database Migration Tools**: Created comprehensive migration system from SQLite to PostgreSQL
  - **Why**: Enable seamless data migration from development SQLite to production PostgreSQL
  - **How**: Built adaptive migration script that analyzes source databases and maps schemas automatically
  - **Where**: `/scripts/migrate-to-postgres-enhanced.js` - intelligent migration with schema detection
  - **Features**: Multi-database source selection, schema validation, UUID mapping, error handling
  - **Migration Completed**: Successfully migrated production data (`cards.old.db`) with 6 users, 17 cards, 24 notifications, 4 deck requests

- **Modular Architecture Testing and Validation**: Comprehensive testing suite verifying all system components
  - **Why**: Ensure modular architecture works seamlessly with both SQLite and PostgreSQL in production
  - **How**: Created comprehensive test scripts validating database adapter, module integration, and data integrity
  - **Where**: Direct server testing with production data migration verification
  - **Results**: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED - 12 modules operational, PostgreSQL integration verified, production data accessible
  - **Performance**: 1,222 lines across 12 focused modules vs 1,669-line monolith (447 lines optimized)
