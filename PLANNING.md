# Mist of Pandaria Card Tracker â€” Planning Document

## Project Vision
A full-stack, self-hosted web application for World of Warcraft: Mist of Pandaria Classic guilds to transparently track Inscription Cards, deck completions, sales, payouts, and notifications. The goal is to empower guilds with collaborative tools, automated notifications, and robust admin controls, all tailored for MoP Classic.

## High-Level Scope
- **Card & Deck Tracking:** Track all MoP Inscription cards, deck completion status, contributors, and disposition (sold/given).
- **User Management:** Registration, approval, roles (Admin, Officer, User), and profile management.
- **Notifications:** Unified system for in-app, Discord webhook, and per-user Gotify notifications. No email support.
- **Admin Panel:** User approval, deck allocation, analytics, export/import, notification config, and activity log.
- **Activity Log:** Persistent, transparent logging of all major actions.
- **Analytics:** Contributor leaderboard, deck fulfillment speed, card acquisition trends, payout history, and deck value history.
- **Export/Import:** CSV-based data portability for cards and decks (admin only).
- **Responsive UI:** Mobile-friendly, MoP-themed visuals, dark mode, and customizable themes.

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend:** React (SPA), custom CSS for MoP/dark theme, Chart.js for analytics, REST API integration.
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js, RESTful endpoints, JWT authentication, notification logic, SQLite database.
- **Database:** SQLite for persistent storage of cards, decks, users, notifications, config, and activity log.
- **Notifications:**
  - In-app: Real-time updates and notification center.
  - Discord: Automated webhook for deck completions, sales, requests.
  - Gotify: Per-user server/token/type config, sent via Gotify API.
- **Security:**
  - JWT-based authentication for all protected endpoints.
  - Admin-only actions for user approval, deck allocation, export/import, and analytics.
  - Automated security checks (npm audit, ggshield) with Gotify alerts.

- **Dependencies:**
  - Install: `npm install && cd client && npm install`
- **Deployment:**
  - Access: `http://localhost:5000`
