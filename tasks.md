## Active Development Tasks

### 1. Code Cleanup - Split Large Files (500+ Line Limit)
**Priority: High** - Improve maintainability and reduce complexity

**Files requiring refactoring:**
- `server-auth.js` (1,669 lines) - Main backend file needs modularization
- `client/src/App.js` (716 lines) - Frontend main component needs component splitting  
- `client/src/Admin.js` (541 lines) - Admin panel needs feature-based splitting

**Sub-tasks:**
- Split `server-auth.js` into modules (routes, middleware, database, notifications)
- Break down `App.js` into smaller components and custom hooks
- Modularize `Admin.js` into separate admin feature components
- Ensure proper import/export structure for all split files
- Maintain existing functionality during refactoring
- Add comprehensive tests for new modules

### 2. Complete Docker Containerization
**Priority: High** - Dockerize entire application stack for simplified deployment

**Benefits:**
- **One-Command Deployment**: `docker-compose up` deploys entire stack (app + PostgreSQL)
- **Consistent Environment**: Identical setup across development, staging, production
- **Platform Independence**: Runs on any system with Docker (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- **Isolated Environment**: No host system conflicts, better security
- **Simplified Backup**: Docker volume snapshots and container exports
- **Easy Updates**: Pull new images, restart containers
- **Resource Management**: Built-in memory/CPU limits and health monitoring

**Docker Architecture:**
- **Web Container**: Node.js + Express + React build (Alpine Linux base)
- **Database Container**: PostgreSQL 15+ with persistent data volumes
- **Nginx Container**: Reverse proxy with SSL termination (optional)
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrate all services with networking and volumes
- **Health Checks**: Automated container health monitoring and restart
- **Development Mode**: Hot reload for development, production build for deployment

**Sub-tasks:**
- Create optimized Dockerfile for Node.js application (multi-stage build)
- Design docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL, web app, and networking
- Configure persistent volumes for PostgreSQL data and application logs
- Add health checks for all containers with automatic restart policies
- Create development and production Docker Compose configurations
- Update deployment scripts to use Docker instead of direct installation
- Add Docker-based backup and restore procedures
- Create Docker update scripts and rollback procedures
- Add container monitoring and logging configuration
- Update documentation for Docker-based deployment

### 3. Database System Replacement: SQLite â†’ PostgreSQL
**Priority: High** - Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL for production scalability

**Benefits:**
- Better concurrent user support (50+ simultaneous connections)
- Advanced features: JSON columns, full-text search, window functions
- Enterprise-grade backup and recovery solutions
- Superior performance for analytics and complex queries
- Connection pooling and better resource management

**Implementation Plan (Fresh Install - No Migration Needed):**
- Design PostgreSQL schema with improved data types (UUID, JSONB, timestamps)
- Update application code to use PostgreSQL connection pooling
- Implement enhanced indexing strategy for better performance
- Add advanced PostgreSQL features: full-text search, analytics queries
- Create comprehensive backup and recovery procedures
- **Note**: PostgreSQL will be containerized as part of Docker implementation

**Sub-tasks:**
- Design PostgreSQL schema with UUID primary keys and JSON columns
- Create database initialization scripts for PostgreSQL
- Update database abstraction layer for PostgreSQL compatibility
- Implement connection pooling with proper error handling
- Add advanced PostgreSQL features (full-text search, window functions)
- Update backup scripts for PostgreSQL (pg_dump instead of file copy)
- Create PostgreSQL Docker container configuration
- Add database health checks and monitoring

### 3. Comprehensive Code Error Checking
**Priority: High** - Identify and fix potential runtime issues

**Areas to check:**
- ESLint/JSHint analysis for syntax errors and best practices
- TypeScript-style type checking for JavaScript files
- Unused variables and imports cleanup
- Console.log statements removal for production
- Error handling consistency across all files
- Database query error handling and null checks
- Frontend state management error boundaries

### 4. Database Query Optimization & Security
**Priority: High** - Improve database performance and security

**Issues found:**
- Multiple `SELECT *` queries should specify required columns only
- Raw SQL queries without proper error handling in some places
- Potential N+1 query problems in admin dashboard
- Missing database indexes for frequently queried columns
- Some database operations lack proper transaction handling

**Sub-tasks:**
- Replace `SELECT *` with specific column lists
- Add database indexes for performance optimization
- Implement proper transaction handling for multi-step operations
- Add SQL injection protection validation
- Optimize complex queries with JOINs instead of multiple round trips

### 5. Production Console Output Cleanup
**Priority: Medium** - Remove debug output for production readiness

**Issues found:**
- 50+ console.log/console.error statements throughout codebase
- Debug logging mixed with error logging
- API request logging in production (line 98 in server-auth.js)
- Test files have console output that should be cleaned up

**Sub-tasks:**
- Implement proper logging system (Winston/Bunyan)
- Replace console.log with appropriate log levels
- Remove debug console statements from production code
- Add environment-based logging configuration
- Preserve error logging while removing debug output

### 6. Frontend Performance & Code Quality Issues  
**Priority: Medium** - Optimize React components and patterns

**Issues found:**
- Inline styles mixed with CSS classes (8 instances found)
- Missing React optimization patterns (useMemo, useCallback)
- Large useEffect dependencies that could cause unnecessary re-renders
- Potential memory leaks in event listeners and timers
- Inconsistent error boundary implementations

**Sub-tasks:**
- Move all inline styles to CSS classes for better performance
- Add React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper useCallback for event handlers
- Add error boundaries for better error handling
- Optimize re-rendering patterns with useMemo
- Clean up event listeners and subscriptions in useEffect cleanup

### 8. Security Vulnerabilities & Input Validation
**Priority: High** - Secure all endpoints and user inputs

**Areas requiring security review:**
- All `req.body`, `req.params`, `req.query` usage lacks input validation
- No sanitization of user inputs before database insertion
- Missing rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- JWT secret should use environment variable consistently
- CORS configuration may be too permissive for production
- No CSRF protection implemented

**Sub-tasks:**
- Add input validation middleware (Joi/Yup) for all endpoints
- Implement rate limiting with express-rate-limit
- Add input sanitization for all user data
- Review and harden CORS configuration
- Add CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Implement proper password strength requirements
- Add security headers (helmet.js)

### 9. Testing Coverage & Quality
**Priority: Medium** - Improve test coverage and reliability  

**Current test status:**
- Basic API tests exist but minimal coverage
- No frontend component tests
- No integration tests for critical workflows
- Missing error scenario testing
- No performance/load testing

**Sub-tasks:**
- Expand API test coverage to include error cases
- Add React Testing Library tests for all components
- Create integration tests for user workflows (login, card management)
- Add database mocking for consistent test environments
- Implement test coverage reporting (Istanbul/NYC)
- Add CI/CD pipeline testing automation
- Create performance benchmarks for critical operations

### 10. Advanced Architecture & Scaling Improvements
**Priority: Low** - Advanced features for future growth

**Potential improvements:**
- Consider splitting into microservices as application grows significantly
- Add Redis for session management in clustered deployments
- Plan for horizontal scaling if user base grows beyond single server
- Implement advanced monitoring and alerting systems
- Add automated testing pipelines with multiple environments

**Sub-tasks:**
- Research microservices architecture for future scaling
- Add health check endpoints for advanced monitoring
- Create monitoring dashboard integration (Grafana/Prometheus)
- Document scaling procedures for larger deployments
- Plan multi-server deployment strategies
