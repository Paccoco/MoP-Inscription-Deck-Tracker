## Active Development Tasks

### 1. Code Cleanup - Split Large Files (500+ Line Limit) ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Priority: High** - Improve maintainability and reduce complexity

**✅ Completed Backend Modularization:**
- ✅ **server-auth.js Split**: Modularized 1,669-line monolithic file into clean architecture
- ✅ **Route Separation**: Created 8 focused route modules (auth, admin, cards, decks, config, system, profile, announcements)
- ✅ **Service Layer**: Extracted notification services into dedicated modules
- ✅ **Middleware**: Separated authentication middleware for reusability
- ✅ **Utilities**: Organized database adapters, logging, and utilities into logical modules
- ✅ **Main Server**: Clean 62-line server.js with modular imports and clear structure

**✅ Modular Architecture Results:**
- **Total Lines**: 1,602 lines across 12+ well-organized files vs 1,669 lines in single file
- **Maintainability**: Each module has single responsibility and clear purpose
- **Testing**: Individual modules can be tested in isolation
- **Development**: Multiple developers can work on different modules simultaneously
- **Code Quality**: Better separation of concerns and reduced complexity

**Remaining Frontend Files:**
- `client/src/App.js` (716 lines) - Frontend main component needs component splitting  
- `client/src/Admin.js` (541 lines) - Admin panel needs feature-based splitting

**Sub-tasks:**
- ✅ Split `server-auth.js` into modules (routes, middleware, database, notifications)
- Break down `App.js` into smaller components and custom hooks
- Modularize `Admin.js` into separate admin feature components
- Ensure proper import/export structure for all split files
- Maintain existing functionality during refactoring
- Add comprehensive tests for new modules

### 2. Comprehensive Code Error Checking ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Priority: High** - Identify and fix potential runtime issues

**✅ Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ **Winston Logging System**: Implemented production-grade logging with file rotation
- ✅ **Console.log Cleanup**: Replaced 50+ console statements with proper logging
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Improved error handling consistency across all modules  
- ✅ **Logging Imports**: Added logging imports to all necessary modules
- ✅ **Production Configuration**: Environment-based logging with DEBUG/INFO/ERROR levels
- ✅ **Log Files**: Created structured logging with app.log and error.log files
- ✅ **Admin Logging**: Special logging for admin actions and security events

**Results:**
- Removed all debug console.log statements from production code
- Added structured logging with timestamps and error stack traces
- Created 5MB rotating log files with 5-file retention

- Some database operations lack proper transaction handling

**Sub-tasks:**
- Replace `SELECT *` with specific column lists
- Add database indexes for performance optimization
- Implement proper transaction handling for multi-step operations
- Add SQL injection protection validation
- Optimize complex queries with JOINs instead of multiple round trips

### 4. Complete Docker Containerization
**Priority: Medium** - Dockerize entire application stack for simplified deployment

**Benefits:**
- **One-Command Deployment**: `docker-compose up` deploys entire stack (app + PostgreSQL)
- **Consistent Environment**: Identical setup across development, staging, production
- **Platform Independence**: Runs on any system with Docker (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- **Isolated Environment**: No host system conflicts, better security
- **Simplified Backup**: Docker volume snapshots and container exports
- **Easy Updates**: Pull new images, restart containers
- **Resource Management**: Built-in memory/CPU limits and health monitoring

**Docker Architecture:**
- **Web Container**: Node.js + Express + React build (Alpine Linux base)
- **Database Container**: PostgreSQL 15+ with persistent data volumes
- **Nginx Container**: Reverse proxy with SSL termination (optional)
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrate all services with networking and volumes
- **Health Checks**: Automated container health monitoring and restart
- **Development Mode**: Hot reload for development, production build for deployment

**Sub-tasks:**
- Complete optimized Dockerfile for Node.js application (multi-stage build)
- Design docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL, web app, and networking
- Configure persistent volumes for PostgreSQL data and application logs
- Add health checks for all containers with automatic restart policies
- Create development and production Docker Compose configurations
- Update deployment scripts to use Docker instead of direct installation
- Add Docker-based backup and restore procedures
- Create Docker update scripts and rollback procedures
- Add container monitoring and logging configuration
- Update documentation for Docker-based deployment

### 5. Database System Replacement: SQLite → PostgreSQL
**Priority: Medium** - Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL for production scalability

**Issues found:**
- Multiple `SELECT *` queries should specify required columns only
- Raw SQL queries without proper error handling in some places
- Potential N+1 query problems in admin dashboard
- Missing database indexes for frequently queried columns
- Some database operations lack proper transaction handling

**Sub-tasks:**
- Replace `SELECT *` with specific column lists
- Add database indexes for performance optimization
- Implement proper transaction handling for multi-step operations
- Add SQL injection protection validation
- Optimize complex queries with JOINs instead of multiple round trips

### 6. Production Console Output Cleanup
**Priority: Medium** - Remove debug output for production readiness

**Issues found:**
- 50+ console.log/console.error statements throughout codebase
- Debug logging mixed with error logging

- Duplicate or obsolete script files that are no longer used
- Unused configuration files from previous architecture
- Deprecated deployment scripts replaced by Docker/modular approach
- Old backup files and temporary development scripts
- Unused dependencies in package.json (both server and client)
- Legacy documentation files that no longer apply to 2.0 architecture

**Sub-tasks:**
- Archive or remove original `server-auth.js` once modular version is tested and deployed
- Audit all script files in root directory for continued relevance
- Remove unused npm dependencies using `npm-check-unused` or similar tools
- Clean up old configuration files (check if still needed for compatibility)
- Remove temporary files and old backup scripts
- Update .gitignore to exclude generated/temporary files
- Document which files were removed and why (for rollback reference)
- Verify no hard-coded references to removed files exist in codebase

**Note:** This task should be completed after major modularization and Docker work is done and tested in production.

### 9. Security Vulnerabilities & Input Validation
