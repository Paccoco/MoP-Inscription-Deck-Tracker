# Codebase Streamlining Task Plan (2025-07-25)

## Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Identify and List Redundant Patterns** ✅
   - Review major files (`App.js`, `Admin.js`, `CompletedDecks.js`, `Profile.js`, `Notifications.js`, backend endpoints) for repeated logic, UI, and data-fetching patterns.

2. **Create Shared Components and Hooks (Frontend)** ✅
   - Extract repeated table, form, and navigation UI into reusable React components (e.g., `CardTable`, `DeckTable`, `NavBar`).
   - Build custom hooks for common data fetching and error/loading state management (e.g., `useFetchCards`, `useFetchDecks`, `useFetchNotifications`).

3. **Refactor Large Components** ✅
   - Split large files (`App.js`, `Admin.js`) into smaller, focused components for each page/feature.
   - Move domain-specific logic (e.g., deck status, contributor breakdown) into utility functions.

4. **Backend Logic Consolidation** ✅
   - Refactor notification delivery and activity logging into helper functions to avoid duplication.
   - Merge similar endpoints (e.g., CSV export/import, deck/card history) where possible.

5. **Optimize Conditional Rendering and State** ✅
   - Simplify deeply nested conditionals and group related UI logic.
   - Centralize error and loading state handling.

6. **Bug Check and Validate** ✅
   - Run lint, type checks, and test flows for all refactored code.
   - Validate notification delivery and activity logging after refactoring.

7. **Update Documentation** ✅
   - Update `README.md` to reflect new shared components, hooks, and backend helpers.
   - Document any changes to API endpoints or usage patterns.

8. **User Confirmation and Git Workflow** ✅
   - Ask for user confirmation before committing/pushing changes to GitHub.
   - Ensure README and codebase are in sync before reporting completion.

All streamlining tasks are now complete and verified bug free. Codebase and documentation are up to date.
